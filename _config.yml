    Hello world 🙋🏻‍♂️

    I'm a Software Developer graduated in Mechatronic Engineering.

    I am not afraid to face new challenges, and that is exactly what my job offers me everyday. I have to adapt my mindset to the IT industry and this is something I find very fun and interesting so far.

    ➤ Until now I learned how to:
    - write modular, maintainable code (experience with Java, Kotlin, Python and Golang),
    - reason about software design as well as microservices, gRPC and CLI software development.
    - working using Source Code Management (GitHub), CI & CD (Github Actions), Testing : BDD (Cucumber) & TDD (JUnit), Cloud (AWS).
    - use and respect methodologies (Scrum & Kanban),
    - apply the DevOps mindset.

    ➤ Now, I'm learning how to handle people problems and create relevant contents for my peers. I'm also studying and improving my skills with the Python and Golang programming languages.

    ➤ Goal : Turning complexity into simplicity, sharing my knowledge as much as possible and improving my skills to take care of more complex features.

            Every company needs its projects properly implemented and Zup Innovation is no exception. I'm responsible for developing software solutions, leading less senior developers as well as creating and publishing IT contents.
